        "Simulate scam message variations (spelling changes, emoji insertions, space manipulation)",
        "Train on obfuscation techniques (1 instead of I, @ instead of a)",
        "Detect semantic intent even with different wording",
        "Monitor for unusual character encodings and Unicode tricks",
        "Red team exercises where security team creates new scam variants"

  "deployment_recommendations": {
    "real_time_processing": "Use edge computing for low-latency detection (<100ms response time)",
    "scalability": "Containerized microservices architecture to handle millions of messages daily",
    "privacy": "On-device pattern matching first, only send to cloud for AI analysis when confidence threshold met",
    "audit_trail": "Log all detections with conversation context for regulatory compliance and forensics",
    "user_transparency": "Provide explanations for why message was flagged (e.g., 'Contains urgency + payment request + unknown UPI ID')",
    "integration_points": "SMS gateway, WhatsApp Business API, banking apps, payment wallets, telecom operators",
    "human_in_loop": "Escalate 10-20% of borderline cases to human analysts for verification and learning",
    "performance_monitoring": "Track precision, recall, F1 score, false positive rate, detection latency, user satisfaction"
